# Analysis-of-Chicago-Crime-Data
I analysed the Chicago crime dataset from 2001 - 2022 and performed the following:
1. I obtained the Months, Days & Seasons with the highest crime record. I used a bar chart to visualize the types of crimes committed within these Months, Days, Seasons & what crimes are highest and lowest.
2. I obtained the location where crime happened the most.
