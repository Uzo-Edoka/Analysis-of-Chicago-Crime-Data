# Analysis-of-Chicago-Crime-Data
I analyzed the Chicago crime dataset and perfromed the following: 
1. I dropped redundant columns (a redundant colum is one that gives infromation that another column already explains: eg ID and Case number). 
2. I created new columns for Months, Day, Season and year to enable me get the info I want.
3. I used subsetting and grouping to show how the frequency of crime is distributed within Months, Days, Seasons with the most crime record and what crimes are highest and lowest.
4. Based on location description, I obtained where crime happened the most.
