# Analysis-of-Chicago-Crime-Data
I analysed the Chicago crime dataset and performed the following:
1. I dropped redundant columns.
2. I created new columns for Months, Day, Season and year to enable me get the info I want.
3. I used sub-setting and grouping to show how the frequency of crime is distributed within Months, Days, Seasons with the most crime record and what crimes are highest and lowest.
4. Based on location description, I obtained where crime happened the most.
