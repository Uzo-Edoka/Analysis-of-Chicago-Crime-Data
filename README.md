# Analysis-of-Chicago-Crime-Data
I analysed the Chicago crime dataset and performed the following:
1. I dropped redundant columns.
2. I created new columns for Months, Day, Season and year to enable me get the info I want.
3. I obtained the Months, Days & Seasons with the most crime record. I used a bar chart to visualize the distribution of crimes within these Months, Days, Seasons & what crimes are highest and lowest.
4. Based on location description, I obtained where crime happened the most.
